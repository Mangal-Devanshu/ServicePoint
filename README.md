### Project Details: Household Services Application

#### Problem Statement
This project aims to build an application where:
- **Customers** can book household services, view service providers, and make payments.

To address the problem, several models were designed and implemented using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The key models include:

- **ServiceProfessional**: Contains information about service providers, their approval status, and the services they offer.
- **Category**: Defines service categories (e.g., plumbing, cleaning) with a base price.
- **Service**: Represents individual services under each category.
- **ServiceRequest**: Manages user requests for services, including appointments and payment information.
- **Review**: Allows users to rate and review services.
- **Transaction**: Tracks payments made for services.
